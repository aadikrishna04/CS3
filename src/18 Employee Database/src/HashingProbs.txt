    keys = [10, 100, 32, 45, 58, 126, 1, 29, 200, 400, 15]

    Potential hashing function with < 3 collisions:
        cube the number and then square root it. Round down to the nearest integer. In a set of keys such as the one provided, where there are no duplicate keys, there will not be any collisions
